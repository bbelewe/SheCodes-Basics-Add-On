      The piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when pressed on the
      keys. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys: 52 white
      keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36
      shorter black keys raised above the white keys and set further back, for
      sharps and flats. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches
      (or "notes"), spanning a range of a bit over seven octaves. The black keys
      are for the "accidentals" (F♯/G♭, G♯/A♭, A♯/B♭, C♯/D♭, and D♯/E♭), which
      are needed to play in all twelve keys.
